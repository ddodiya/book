Use the following procedures to install a new version of openSUSE® 12.3. This document gives a quick overview on how to run through a default installation of openSUSE.

### Welcome to openSUSE
For more detailed installation instructions and deployment strategies, see the openSUSE documentation at [Documentation](http://doc.opensuse.org/)

### System Requirements
* Pentium 4 2.4 GHz or AMD64 or Intel EM64T processor recommended
* 512 MB physical RAM (1 GB recommended)

###Installing openSUSE
Use these instructions if there is no existing Linux system on your machine, or if you want to replace an existing Linux system.

1. Insert the openSUSE DVD into the drive, then reboot the computer to start the installation program.![sreen](../images/1.jpg)
2. Select * Installation * on the boot screen and press `Enter`. This loads the openSUSE installation program and starts the installation in normal mode.

3. Select the language and the keyboard layout to be used during the installation and for the installed system.

    Read the License Agreement and proceed with *Next* if you agree. If you do not agree, press *Abort* to terminate the installation ![sceen](../images/1.3.png)

4. Select *New Installation* and proceed with *Next*.

6. Select the desktop system you would like to use. *KDE* and *GNOME*, are powerful graphical desktop environments, with KDE being a bit similar to Windows, alternative selections are available when checking Other. Proceed with *Next*.

7. Define a partition setup for openSUSE in this step. In most cases a reasonable scheme that can be accepted without change is proposed. Accept the proposal with *Next* and proceed with the installation. Experienced users can also customize the proposal (* Edit Partition Setup *) or apply their own partitioning scheme (* Create Partition Setup *).

8.  Type your first and last name in the User’s Full Name field, your login name in the Username field, and your password in the Password field.

    For security reasons, your password should be at least eight characters long and should contain uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers. Passwords are case-sensitive.

    By default, the password you enter here is also used for the system administrator, `root`. Uncheck Use this password for system administrator if you prefer to specify a different password for `root` in the next step.

    With automatic login enabled, the system boots straight to your desktop with no authentication at all. If you store sensitive data on your system, you should not enable this option as long as the computer can also be accessed by others.

    Proceed with *Next*.

9.	Type a password for the system administrator account (called the `root` user). This step is skipped in case you had activated *Use this Password for System Administrator* in the previous step.

    You should never forget the `root` password. After you enter it here, the password cannot be retrieved. It can only be reset with administrative assistance. Proceed with *Next*.

13.	After completing the installation of all selected software packages and the basic system setup, the openSUSE installation boots into the new Linux system, to perform the automatic system configuration. This routine configures your network and Internet access and sets up your hardware. This process does not need any interaction.
