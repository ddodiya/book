7. Define a partition setup for openSUSE in this step. In most cases a reasonable scheme that can be accepted without change is proposed. Accept the proposal with *Next* and proceed with the installation. Experienced users can also customize the proposal (* Edit Partition Setup *) or apply their own partitioning scheme (* Create Partition Setup *).

8.  Type your first and last name in the User’s Full Name field, your login name in the Username field, and your password in the Password field.

    For security reasons, your password should be at least eight characters long and should contain uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers. Passwords are case-sensitive.

    By default, the password you enter here is also used for the system administrator, `root`. Uncheck Use this password for system administrator if you prefer to specify a different password for `root` in the next step.

    With automatic login enabled, the system boots straight to your desktop with no authentication at all. If you store sensitive data on your system, you should not enable this option as long as the computer can also be accessed by others.

    Proceed with *Next*.
